# CTalk
A pun on Smalltalk and C

## How does this work?

When you build this project, you are building a trans-compiler from CTalk to C.
You can use stuff from C in CTalk, not the other way around though (as of now).

To build, simply run `gradlew run` and the trans-compiler will translate the demo
source file.
